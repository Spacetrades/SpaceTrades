## Design Principles
1. If it works, don't fix it
2. Remain consistent (Keep order in chaos)
3. Less is more
4. Better to undersalt then oversalt on design
5. ST is holistic and every part no matter how small reflects the whole
6. Consider automation at every instance of feasibility
7. **DRY**
8. Go the step further. Always go a little bit beyond the standard design practice so that users understand the site is willing to go the extra mile for them.
9. You are not designing for yourself
10. Provide content with the least amount of information as possible for readability sake.
11. Just because functionality can exist doesn't mean it should
12. Find simplicity in confusing complexity. Don't let users get lost.

## Commit Messages Language ( CML )
```
Extensive undertandability is less crucial in the beginning stage of development and for this reason it is not necessarily helpful to use highly descriptive commit messages. Once everything works, better documentation can be added. 
```
### Keywords:
	INIT - First Commit
	UPDATE - Changes due to involuntary updating of versions
	EDIT - Edit existing file, ADD - Add code, RM - Remove code
	ADD - Add new file
	EX - Specifying an example of the task at hand
	RM - Remove File
	RN - Rename existing file or files
	// - Comment
	Rm - Readme
	md - Markdown
	STYLE - Commits mostly for styling purposes
	FIX - Something broken has been fixed, not just a change for preference but a solution to a noticeable defect
	USE - Something new piece of functionality is finally being used
	LOTS - Lots of changes have been made and I'm to lazy to create commit messages for all the changes
	MINOR - A few changes have been made
	WARN - This commit may be hazardous but i'm commiting anyway :smirk:
	CRUCIAL - This commit deals with (FIX, BREAK, CHANGE)'s a core part of the application
	-// - Comments have been removed
	HOTFIX - FIX for either LOW, MEDIUM or CRUCIAL issue quickly
	CAT - Commits based mostly on categorization. Ex: Creating new folders for code, moving code bits around. Merging files...etc
	INFECT - Merge is receiving errors
	MANDATE - Specify necessary tasks of a file that must be accomodated. These can be style rules or required jobs to complete.
	TASK - A task to complete in a certain file
	COMMENT REASON - Specify the reason why you have left the code commented and have not simply removed it
	BEWARE - Specify something that should not be done and explain what should be done.
	BREAK - Something is breaking 
	BREAK CRUCIAL - Something is breaking which is crucial for the site
	IDEAL - A suggestion to do something differently or a way that may or may not be possible soon but is ideal
	FMT - Data is good but display isn't. Data should be displayed in a different way as specified.
	TODO: Specify tasks to complete

## Sublime Stuff
	[
	{ "keys": ["ctrl+shift+r"], "command": "reindent" },
	{ "keys": ["ctrl+alt+shift+w"], "command": "close_all" } Closes Tabs

	Make one for refreshing folders
	]

## Server:
	/opt/spacetrades - Location of ST files
	server - ~/.bash_profile command for ssh server login
	Run -  npm update mup -g if Error OR Try again and it might actually work the second time *facepalm*

	Meteor.users.update( Meteor.userId(), {$push: { "profile.files": downloadUrl } } );

	https://www.resrc.it/
	Use Lookback SEO

## Tasks:
	ChatOps
	https://www.resrc.it/pricing/us
	Implement Flow Router and Flow layouts
	Make system for cutting out TASKS and sending with @
	Make subtle animation on offer count change
	Make Social media profiles for those included in footer

## Formatting:
	Mongo - Listing.find({ _id: id}); NOT Listing.find({_id:id});
	jQuery - $( ".cardul" ).hide() NOT $(".cardul") AKA Parenthesis Padding *PP*
	SCSS - ALLOW double letter bonding Ex: .prohibiteddiv and NOT .prohibitediv
	LR - Left Right
	JS - Conditional blocks receive 1ln padding on top and bottom
	JS - Comments receive 1ln padding on top
	JS - If else blocks evade previous rule
	JS - Line breaks must always be purposeful
	JS - LR 1char spacing for mathematical characters
	JS - Single Line, Block, Inline Comments
	JS - Block uses Dividers with Open: * x 4 : //C// and //-C//
	JS - Objects get there own TB 1ln padding
	JS - Significantly different code sections receive BL 1ln padding
	JS - Console.log's get grouped if possible into sections using //L// and //-L//
	URL Names - Do not group words that end and begin with the same letter for readability sake. Ex: selllisting - Bad, listingsell - Good
	Files - Everything of its own significant gravity should be its own file
	JS Callback functions - Keep on same line as caller function Ex:$(".searchRefineCategories li input").each( function () {
	JS - New functionality requires a brief comment before it. This may be removed eventually
